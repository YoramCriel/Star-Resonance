# Star Resonance


###What?

Echo of connecting stars.

This is an experiment with particles that represent stars in the endlessness of space.
Connect the stars to the main star to create cool sound effects.

-------------------------------------------

###How does it work:

1. Main star:

The main star controls everything. Move this main star to a star particle and press on it. This creates a connection by drawing a line between the main star and the star particle.
When the main star is pressed all star particles are pulled towards it. A long press
removes the star particles from the main star. A sound is played to confirm the removal
of the star particles.


2. The main stars tail:

The tail consist out of lines and circle particles. By moving the main star faster the tail gets long and the background volume increases when slowing down the opposite happens. These particles interact with the star and the line particles. When they collide a sound effect is played. This effect depends on the fact they collided with a star or line.

3. The star particles:

Star particles appear randomly on right side of the screen, the can be connected to the main star by pressing on them with the main star. When stars collide with each other, the tail of the main star or there is collision between the lines a sound effect will be played. More stars means that more stars can collide and this means better and cooler sound effects.
